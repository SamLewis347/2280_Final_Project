# 2280_Final_Project
 Final python coding project for Dr. Burke in CSC2280
# Final Project Instructions:
 The only thing that you need to know for running my projects is that you need to have all of the .gif images in the same folder
 as the python code when you run it, since I change the shapes of my turtles with said .gif files using .register_shape() and .shape().
